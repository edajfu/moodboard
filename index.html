<p>just a few notes</p>

<h3>Important people come and go, and that's okay. </h3>

Unfortunately, the most important people in your life can become strangers overnight. <br> Fortunately, total strangers can become the most important people in your life overnight. This process hurts, but if accepted, it serves to improve the quality and suitability of the people in your life. 

<h3>How you spend your days is how you live your life. </h3>

This is it.

<h3>You don't have to be liked or understood by everyone. </h3>

You and your mental health are more important than your career, more money, other people's opinions, that event you said you would attend, your partner's mood, and your family's wishes. If taking care of yourself means letting someone down, then let someone down. Your self-love must always be stronger than your desire to be loved by others.

<h3>Try not to let rejection lead to self-rejection.</h3>

A person who has experienced rejection fears rejection and a person that fears rejection tends to push or run away before they can be rejected. In their subconscious mind, they have avoided rejection. In reality, they've been rejected again this time by themselves.

<h3>Life shouldn't have been so hard on you, but it made you hard on others.</h3>

You're not responsible for your trauma but you are responsible for breaking the cycle and not hurting more people because of what happened to you. You will never control your future if you let your present be controlled by your past. <br> What happened yesterday may not be your responsibility, but how you behave today is.

<h3>Don't chase a mirage.</h3>

Obsessing over the things that society said you're "supposed to do" will kill your happiness. <br> Don't listen to the fake fairytales of how your life is supposed to be going. <br> You don't have to go to university at 18, get a job at 21, buy a house at 25, get married at 30, or have kids at 35. <br> Everyone is different, and your path to happiness will be too.

<h3>Haste does not bring success.</h3>
